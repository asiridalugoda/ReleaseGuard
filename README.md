# ReleaseGuard

> **The artifact policy engine for `dist/` and `release/` outputs.**

![ReleaseGuard — The Artifact Security Engine](docs/release-guard-banner.png)

ReleaseGuard is an open-source artifact security engine. It scans build outputs for risky content, applies deterministic hardening transforms, generates full SBOMs, signs and attests the final artifacts, and validates them against release policies — locally or in any CI/CD pipeline.

## Why ReleaseGuard?

Most supply-chain security tools focus on source code, dependencies, containers, or runtime admission. ReleaseGuard focuses on the **final distributable** — the exact artifact that leaves your build system.

That means catching things that slip through everything else:
- Secret keys and API tokens embedded in `dist/` bundles
- Source maps accidentally shipped to production
- Debug symbols inside release binaries
- `.env` files and internal hostnames baked into builds
- Unsigned executables in packaged releases

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (macOS / Linux)
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Helixar-AI/ReleaseGuard/main/scripts/install.sh | sh

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/Helixar-AI/ReleaseGuard
cd ReleaseGuard && make install

# Bootstrap config
releaseguard init

# Scan your dist folder
releaseguard check ./dist

# Apply safe hardening transforms
releaseguard fix ./dist

# Generate SBOM
releaseguard sbom ./dist

# Full hardening pipeline
releaseguard harden ./dist
```

---

## What's Included (Free & Open Source)

### Scanning
- Secrets detection (API keys, private keys, tokens, `.env` files)
- Metadata leaks (source maps, debug symbols, build paths, internal URLs)
- Unexpected content (test files, `.git` remnants, CI configs)
- License and notice presence checker

### SBOM Generation
- **All major ecosystems**: Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Java, .NET, Ruby, PHP, Container, System packages
- **Formats**: CycloneDX (JSON + XML), SPDX (JSON + tag-value)
- VEX enrichment via OSV.dev

### Hardening Transforms
- Remove source maps, strip debug info, delete forbidden files
- Normalize archive timestamps for reproducibility
- Add checksums and manifest

### Obfuscation (`light` level — free)
- JS: string encryption, property mangling
- Go: symbol stripping, build path redaction, garble integration
- Python: `.py` source removal, PyArmor integration
- JVM / .NET: symbol renaming, PDB stripping
- Native (ELF / Mach-O / PE): debug section and symbol stripping

### DRM and Anti-Tamper (free)
- Runtime integrity check stub injection (JS, Go, .NET, Python)
- Tamper detection with configurable `exit` or `log` action
- Anti-debug stubs (opt-in)

### Signing and Attestation
- Keyless signing via Sigstore / Fulcio
- Local key signing (GPG, ECDSA)
- in-toto attestation statements
- SLSA Provenance level 2

### Policy Engine
- Built-in YAML rules (severity gates, category gates, license checks)
- Open Policy Agent (Rego) adapter
- Policy bundle loading from local path or OCI registry

### Reporting
- CLI table, JSON, SARIF (GitHub Security tab), Markdown, HTML

## Add to Your README

Show that your release is clean:

```markdown
[\![ReleaseGuard](https://img.shields.io/badge/releaseguard-passing-brightgreen?logo=shield&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Helixar-AI/ReleaseGuard)
```

Renders as: [\![ReleaseGuard](https://img.shields.io/badge/releaseguard-passing-brightgreen?logo=shield&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Helixar-AI/ReleaseGuard)

## GitHub Action

> **Always pin to a commit SHA** — mutable tags can be moved. Replace `<SHA>` with
> the SHA of the release you want, e.g. `229a90dff5a31d7805e5df43bb9230f9fe5ec75c` for v0.1.2.

```yaml
- uses: Helixar-AI/ReleaseGuard@<SHA>  # vX.Y.Z
  with:
    path: ./dist
    sbom: true
    fix: true
    sign: keyless
    format: sarif
```

**CLI flags reference** (for direct use of the `releaseguard` binary):

| Command | Key flags |
|---|---|
| `releaseguard check <path>` | `--format <cli\|json\|sarif\|markdown\|html>`, `--out <file>`, `--config <file>` |
| `releaseguard sbom <path>` | `--format <cyclonedx\|spdx>`, `--out <file>`, `--enrich-cve` |
| `releaseguard fix <path>` | `--dry-run` |
| `releaseguard obfuscate <path>` | `--level <none\|light\|medium\|aggressive>` |
| `releaseguard sign <artifact>` | `--mode <keyless\|local>`, `--key <file>` |

> **Note:** `--fail-on` is **not** a CLI flag. Severity gating (which findings
> fail the build) is configured in `.releaseguard.yml` under `policy.fail-on`.
> The `fail-on` input on the GitHub Action is documentation-only and does not
> pass any flag to the CLI.

## Use with OpenClaw

Install the ReleaseGuard skill from [ClawHub](https://github.com/openclaw/clawhub):

```bash
clawhub install releaseguard
```

Then just ask your agent in plain English:

> *"Scan my ./dist folder for secrets and misconfigs"*
> *"Generate an SBOM for this release"*
> *"Sign the artifact and attest provenance"*
> *"Run the full hardening pipeline on ./dist"*

The skill maps natural language to the full `releaseguard` CLI — check, fix, sbom, sign, attest, verify, report, and vex — and installs the binary automatically if it isn't present.

**Publish your own skill** — the source is at [`skills/releaseguard/SKILL.md`](skills/releaseguard/SKILL.md).
